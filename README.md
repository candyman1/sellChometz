This is a freelance project that is catered to a specific client's needs.  It was created to run on the client's 7" tablet only in portrait mode.
It is intended to collect user information which is then compiled into a printable contract.
The client requested that the app not be published on the Google Play store.
Currently the server is a localhost server, as per client's needs.
